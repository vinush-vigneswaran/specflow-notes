<summary><b>

1. What are the differences between the different test frameworks (xUnit, NUnit, etc.)?</b></summary>
<br>
* These are both unit test frameworks
* NUnit was developed for the .NET framework ported from JUnit.
* xUnit is a more recent Unit Testing Framework
* The main difference between the two is that NUnit will run all the tests using the same class instance, while xUnit will create a new instance for each test.
