### 2.1 - Setting up the Project
We will use a sample project to understand how Selenium can be used, and the benefit of following a Page Object Model pattern.
1. Clone the project into your ``..\code`` file from this [Github repo](https://github.com/SpecFlowOSS/SpecFlow-Examples/tree/master/CalculatorSelenium).

### 2.1 - Selenium with Page Object Model Pattern

* Selenium is an open-source automation framework used for web applications across different browsers and platforms.

* **Page Object Model (POM) :** 
    * POM is a design pattern used to abstract the page into different classes.
    * With this model, you have the element selectors in dedicated locations (class files) and no scattered around in your code.
    * The advantage of the model is that it reduces code duplication and improves test maintenance.
